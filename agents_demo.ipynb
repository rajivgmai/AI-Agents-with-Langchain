      "Summary: Trumpism is a political movement in the United States that comprises the political ideologies associated with U.S. President Donald Trump and his political base. It incorporates ideologies such as right-wing populism, right-wing antiglobalism, national conservatism, and neo-nationalism, and features significant illiberal and authoritarian beliefs. Trumpists and Trumpians are terms that refer to individuals exhibiting its characteristics. There is significant academic debate over the prevalence of neo-fascist elements of Trumpism.\n",
      "Trumpism is associated with the belief that the President is above the rule of law. It has been referred to as an American political variant of the far-right and the national-populist and neo-nationalist sentiment seen in multiple nations starting in the mid-late 2010s. Trump's political base has been compared to a cult of personality. Trump supporters became the largest faction of the United States Republican Party, with the remainder often characterized as  \"the elite\", \"the establishment\" or \"Republican in name only\" (RINO) in contrast. In response to the rise of Trump, there has arisen a Never Trump movement.\n",
      "The label Trumpism has been applied to national-conservative and national-populist movements in other democracies. Politicians labeled as Trumpist by news agencies include Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey, Viktor Orbán of Hungary, Rodrigo Duterte and Bongbong Marcos of the Philippines, Shinzo Abe of Japan, Vladimir Putin of Russia, Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea, Javier Milei of Argentina, and Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia.\n",

      "Born in New York City, Trump graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. He became president of his family real estate business in 1971, and oriented it to luxury accommodation. After a series of business bankruptcies in the 1990s, he launched several side ventures. From 2004 to 2015, he hosted and co-produced the reality television series The Apprentice. In 2015, Trump, widely viewed as a political outsider, launched a Republican presidential campaign with right-wing populist themes that went on to win the 2016 presidential election.\n",
      "During his first term, Trump's immigration policy included a travel ban targeting refugees and nationals of certain Muslim-majority countries, and expanding the U.S.–Mexico border wall; he also briefly implemented a family separation policy. He rolled back many environmental policies, signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, began a trade war with China in 2018, successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, and withdrew the U.S. from agreements on climate, trade, and Iran's nuclear program. Trump became the first sitting president to enter North Korea, but did not reach an agreement on denuclearization with Kim Jong Un. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump downplayed its severity, contradicted guidance from health officials, and signed the CARES Act stimulus.
